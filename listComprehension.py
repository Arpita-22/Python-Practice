# List Comprehension always returns a new list and sometimes the logic is too long

# newList = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]
# newList = [x for x in myList if "a" in x]
# newList = [x for x in range(10) if x < 5]
# newList = [x if x != "a" else "b" for x in myList]

# print(newList)
